## What is the Scheps 73 Waves Plugin?
 
The Scheps 73 Waves plugin is a colorful 3-band EQ modeled on the classic 1073 console's EQ and mic preamp module. It features interrelated bands that adhere to the 1073's original specs and precisely emulate its behavior: a fixed 12kHz high-frequency band, switchable low and midrange bands with cut and boost controls, and an 18dB/octave high-pass filter[^1^]. Additionally, it includes a rare 10kHz midrange band discovered in the original 1073 schematics but operable only on the rare 1078 channel strip[^2^]. And to top it all off, it has a Waves MS matrix that lets you apply different equalization to mid and side stereo content[^2^].
 
The Scheps 73 Waves plugin also captures the harmonic distortion of the original 1073, using innovative procedures to model the acclaimed Marinair transformer. These overtones were tweaked to perfection by Andrew Scheps himself, resulting in beautiful and authentic saturations[^2^]. The Scheps 73 Waves plugin can add warmth, clarity, punch, and character to any sound source, from vocals to drums to guitars.
